This is from a previous project extended to give more information about the computer and added the web browser. 

In MemorySpace, once you run the local host in the web browser as localhost:3001. It will read your systems memory and give it back to 
you in GB. 
It will also tell you how long you have been running and how much free memory you have as well.
